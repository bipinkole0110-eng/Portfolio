- [x] Style input fields (name, email) and textarea with rounded corners, semi-transparent dark background, soft inner glow/thin light border, light gray placeholders, consistent spacing.
- [x] Style the "Send Message" button with pill shape, subtle gradient/glass effect, white text, soft shadow, matching input width.
- [x] Ensure desktop-first responsive layout.
